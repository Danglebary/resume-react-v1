                            . I have worked on various projects ranging from web
                            design and server management, to data science and
                            web automation.
                            <br /> As a developer, I have learned that one of
                            the most vital skills to have is the ability to
                            swiftly acquire knowledge and information you donâ€™t
                            currently possess.
                            <br /> Outside of programming and development, I
                            have enjoyed producing and engineering music.
                            Through running a small record label, managing
                            multiple artist careers and projects, scheduling
                            releases, and facilitating events, I have learned
                            organization and management skills that have helped
                            me become a better developer.
